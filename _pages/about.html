Hello, and welcome to Phay Photos! My name is Taylor Lewis, age 20, of Panama City Florida, and I am a  friendly and enthusiastic photographer who strives to provide affordable and quality photography sessions to Bay County and surrounding areas! My love for photography starting in high school, while taking college level photography courses and learning the various styles and techniques. Recently, my passion for the business grew again after my beautiful wedding in May. I enjoy capturing the spark and joyous moments in life through my photos, and seeing my clients find the beauty in themselves through my photos. Currently, I do not have a studio, and use the natural and man-made backgrounds of Bay County as my inspiration for themes and locations! If you would like to contact me about a photoshoot, or weddings, please use my contact page and I will get back to you as soon as possible. Have a wonderful day!
