&ensp;&ensp;Hello, and welcome to Phay Photos! My name is Taylor Lewis, age 20, of Panama City Florida, and I am a  friendly and enthusiastic photographer who strives to provide affordable and quality photography sessions to Bay County and surrounding areas! My love for photography started in high school, while taking college level photography courses and learning the various styles and techniques. Recently, my passion for the business grew after my beautiful wedding in May. I enjoy capturing the spark and joyous moments in life through my photos while seeing my clients find the beauty in themselves through my photos. Currently, I do not have a studio, so I use natural and man-made backgrounds of Bay County as my inspiration for themes and locations! If you would like to contact me about a photoshoot, please use my contact page on this site and I will get back to you as soon as possible. Have a wonderful day!
