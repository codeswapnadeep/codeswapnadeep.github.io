            Shane Quick is a dedicated full-stack developer who loves to work with others.
            He has done many solo projects which served and continue to serve as wonderful learning tools.
            The most fun he has had on any project was in an Agile team environment building a chess web application.
            He likes to look at his work as a puzzle. It's more interesting that way.
